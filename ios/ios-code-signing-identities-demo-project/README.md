# Code Signing Identities for iOS Projects

📱 This project showcases the essential steps to construct and release a native iOS app with Codemagic. It includes basic steps such as build versioning, code signing, and publishing using the recommended code signing identities approach.

🔑 With code signing identities, Codemagic enables you to upload or fetch a provisioning profile, generate or upload or fetch signing certificates to be utilized for signing iOS applications using App Store APIs.

📄 These files can be easily referenced in the `codemagic.yaml` file, making it more readable and beginner-friendly.

🔐 Code signing identities provides a dedicated section under `Teams > Settings > Code signing identities` where you can upload code signing credentials for all your apps in one place.
